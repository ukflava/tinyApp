## Known bugs
*Compass require to redirect users after logout to /urls - Tinyapp send client an error message after redirect
- if user is not logged in: returns HTML with a relevant error message

*Checker of unique visitors works ONLY if all users can visit short URL page, but requested logic says: 
- if user is logged it but does not own the URL with the given ID: returns HTML with a relevant error message
